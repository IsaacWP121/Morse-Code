# Morse-Code
This is my first serious project, it is supposed to aid anyone who is learning Morse code. I came up with this idea when my class got told to stop talking and me and my friend resorted to a broken Morse code conversation.


# To Do:
- Make Hold delete
- Make Play Back Beep
- Redesign the first menu to include a multiplayer/messager mode
- Optimise pygame by only updating part of the screen
