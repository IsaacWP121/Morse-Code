# Morse-Code
This is my first serious project, it is supposed to aid anyone who is learning Morse code. I came up with this idea when my class got told to stop talking and me and my friend resorted to a broken Morse code conversation.
It could use a reprogram and a fresh touch of paint, I've learnt a lot since making this but I think it's good to have something to compare back to


# To Do:
- Make Hold delete
- Make Play Back Beep
- Optimise pygame by only updating part of the screen
